# feyn_pizza_example

This repository contains the code for a blog post around how to use the QLattice to solve a regression problem with a dataset extracted from a pizza menu. The post goes through semantic types and how they can help you save time and effort on encoding values prior to training the model, and how it makes the models more relatable.

To run, you need to `pip install feyn==1.2.0 pandas numpy sklearn` and need python version 3.6 or newer, as well as a jupyter notebook environment.

You also need a QLattice ([you can sign up here](https://abzu.ai/sign-up?kbroloes@github)).

Have fun!
